# Crop yield prediction
**Crop Yield Prediction Using  Big Data Techniques:**

In recent years, the agriculture sector has been transforming towards data-driven solutions to solve real-time problems through advancements in technology and data analytics. 

- **Objectives:**
1) To get exposure to big data techniques.
2) Yield prediction through Google cloud Big query ML.
3) To create an insightful dashboard using Google looker studio.

- **Study Area:**
This dataset encompasses agricultural data for multiple crops cultivated across various states in India from the year 1997 to 2020.

- **Dataset:**

- **Parameters used:**
1) Crop: The name of the crop cultivated.
2) Crop Year: The year in which the crop was grown.
3) Season: The specific cropping season (e.g., Kharif, Rabi, Whole Year).
4) State: The Indian state where the crop was cultivated.
5) Area: The total land area (in hectares) under cultivation for the specific crop.
6) Production: The quantity of crop production (in metric tons).
7) Annual Rainfall: The annual rainfall received in the crop-growing region (in mm).
8) Fertilizer: The total amount of fertilizer used for the crop (in kilograms).
9) Pesticide: The total amount of pesticide used for the crop (in kilograms).
10) Yield: The calculated crop yield (production per unit area).

- **Algorithm Used:**
1) Linear regression.
2) AutoML regression.
3) Linear regression with L1 regularization.
4) Random Forest Regressor.
5) Boosted Tree regressor.
